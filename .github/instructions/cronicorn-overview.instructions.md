# Cronicorn – Project Overview

## What is Cronicorn?

Cronicorn is a smart scheduler for developers. Instead of setting fixed times for jobs to run, you just describe what should happen and when — and Cronicorn figures out the rest.

---

## Why It Exists

Most cron jobs run on autopilot, even when nothing needs to happen. They're either too frequent or too late. Developers spend time writing extra logic to handle edge cases or skipped runs.

Cronicorn takes a different approach: it listens to real signals from your system and decides when a task should run — or when it shouldn’t.

---

## Why Developers Like It

- **No cron syntax** – Just write what should happen in plain language.
- **Smarter behavior** – Runs more when they need to, less when they dont.
- **Simple integration** – Define endpoints, send context, and go.
- **Less guesswork** – Stop wondering how often a job should run.

---

## What Makes It Different

- Every job reacts to live data — no hardcoded intervals.
- You stay in control with a simple job description and a few endpoints.
- It's built to fit into real-world workflows with minimal setup.

## Our Goal

We want developers to stop babysitting schedules. Cronicorn helps you spend less time maintaining timers and more time building. Whether it’s health checks, alerts, retraining models, or syncing systems — your jobs should run when they’re actually needed.
