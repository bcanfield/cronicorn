You’ve wired up three layers of type-safe schema definitions using drizzle-zod:

Database layer (Drizzle ORM + Zod)

In schema.ts you define your tables with Drizzle’s pgTable API.
You then call createSelectSchema(table) and createInsertSchema(table, customValidators) from drizzle-zod to spit out Zod schemas that exactly match your Drizzle table definitions.
• selectJobsSchema gives you a Zod type for everything the database will send you back.
• insertJobsSchema (and its .partial() offspring patchJobsSchema) give you a Zod type for everything you’re allowed to insert/update, plus any custom validation rules (min, max, etc.), with unwanted fields omitted or made required/optional.
API layer (Hono + zod-openapi)

In your route definitions (jobs.routes.ts), you import those Zod schemas and feed them straight into Hono’s createRoute({ … request: { body: jsonContentRequired(insertJobsSchema) }, responses: { … jsonContent(selectJobsSchema) } }).
That does two things:
a) automatically validates incoming JSON bodies and path params at runtime (and returns a 422 if Zod rejects),
b) infers the TypeScript types for c.req.valid("json") / c.req.valid("param") in your handlers, so your handler code is fully typed.
It also generates OpenAPI docs for free, based on the same Zod schemas.
Client/UI layer (generated API client + React-Query)

You generate a TypeScript OpenAPI client from those routes (via @tasks-app/api/schema or whatever your codegen setup is). That client surfaces both the shapes of responses (matching selectJobsSchema) and the shapes of request bodies (matching insertJobsSchema / patchJobsSchema).
In your React-Query hooks (jobs.queries.ts), you import the Zod-derived TypeScript types (e.g. insertJobsSchema, patchJobsSchema) directly and use them as the argument types of createJob(job: insertJobsSchema) or updateJob({ id, job: patchJobsSchema }), so you get compile-time errors if you try to send an invalid shape.
End-to-end, you’re defining one source of truth (your Drizzle table definitions), generating Zod validators from them, using those for both runtime validation in your API and TypeScript types in both your API handlers and your UI client. That guarantees your database shape, your HTTP API contract, and your frontend inputs/outputs all stay perfectly in sync.
